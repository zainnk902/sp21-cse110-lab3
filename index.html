<p>This day mainly involved planning my project with my club group. We are starting a new project this quarter, which is a recruitment tool that our club will use to recruite more people and will automate many tasks. We discussed who will be developing what parts of the project, which led to an interesting conversation of what different parts we could automate with our tool.</p>
